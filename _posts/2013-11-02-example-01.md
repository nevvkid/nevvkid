Here's a quick roundup of what kept everybody busy this week:

Michael did some groundwork for knockknock. Arved did some interaction and interface design for the same project. Also Sthuthi was involved in it, working on the visual design. Henne crashed and fixed his IDE and wrote some CSS for – you guessed it – knockknock. David continued with documenting complex grid systems for Puichon, with a help from Sigrid. I too was documenting a design we've been working on in the last weeks for another project. Michael and I did an ideation workshop with a client, and Christophe (technically still on vacation) and Michael went to Hildesheim for a teaching assignment.
